Dashboard for Dpos delegate information, Masternodes status, staking info and crypto Wallets

An overview of all your important Dpos delegate information, Masternodes status, staking info or even just crypto Wallets!
Crypto Dashboard is made to sort these things out and present you all your important information in one handy overview.



## Installing it

First clone the crypto dashboard repository, install python and requests:

```git clone https://github.com/ThamarD/cdashboard```

```cd cdashboard```

```apt-get install python3-pip```

```pip3 install requests```


## Configure it

To configure the Dashboard we need to open the config.json. With this install you get an example config.json ("config_example.json") which you need to copy and change with your own parameters and coin basic information.

```cp config_example.json config.json```

Note: Never fill in your private keys, the crypto dashboard doesn't need these, we only work with public addresses!!! 

The parameters:
- cryptodashboard_file_version: internal check if version is correct for updates
- crunch_history: true or false; currently not functioning yet!
- logfile: the file where all coin info is stored and added; default "cdashboard.json"; you can change the logile name the way you like (handy for setting up multiple config files with multiple log files, using one python script)
- coins: section where the coin info is represented
   - identifier: coin identifier, 
      - coin: coin name
      - node: Dpos coin node web address (if coin not a Dpos coin, fill the exploreraddress)
      - pubaddress: the public address of the coin
      - cointype: options are: dpos_delegate, dpos_private, masternode, pos_staking and wallet
         - currently, dpos_delegate is the first section of the dashboard; and dpos_private, masternode, pos_staking and wallet, are the second section of the dashboard. If you want to change this, you can do this in the case-statement in the app.js.
      - exploreraddress: coin explorer web address (for cointype: masternode, pos_staking and wallet)



Example config.json:
```
{
  "cryptodashboard_file_version": 0.6,
  "crunch_history": false,
  "logfile": "cdashboard.json",
  "coins": {
    "OXY Dutchpool Mainnet": {
      "coin": "OXY",
      "node": "https://wallet.oxycoin.io",
      "pubaddress": "15957132064002739627X",
      "cointype": "dpos_delegate"
    },
    "ONZ Dutchpool Mainnet": {
      "coin": "ONZ",
      "node": "https://node10.onzcoin.com",
      "pubaddress": "ONZkL6Jm1MKGWnVzMzkJ8jwTxbQ8Cudqh1Hw",
      "cointype": "dpos_delegate"
    }
  }
}
``` 
    


## Start it:

```python3 cryptodashboard.py```

or if you want to use another config file:

```python3 cryptodashboard.py -c config2.json```

It produces a file (if default) "cdashboard.json" with all the crypto dashboard information which can be presented with the included HTML setup.


We advise to run the cryptodashboard script every hour to collect it's data. The cronjob to configure this (use crontab -e):

`00 * * * * cd ~/cdashboard && python3 ~/cdashboard/cryptodashboard.py`

When the script is ready and configured; you can setup the web environment, see the setup file "cdsahsboard_site_setup.txt".


## Command line usage

```
usage: cryptodashboard.py [-h] [-c config.json] [-y]

Crypto dashboard script

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config.json        set a config file (default: config.json)

```


## Supported/tested chains / explorers

At the moment CryptDashboard supports and is tested on the following chains / explorers:
- Dpos:  OXY, LWF, ONZ, LISK, ARK, SHIFT, RISE
- all clones of Iquidus Explorer 

Known issues:
- a lot of explorer chains are not supported yet; working on it!
- chainz.cryptoid.info - basic info is working, no last TX and date-received

## Changelog

### 0.6
- Initial release


## To Do
We are planning to integrate other cool features:
- support for more coin explorers (e.g. BTC and ETC)
- in the HTML overview, select the history period with a dropdown, now it is 24h and 48h;
- add a live indication in the Dpos main dashboard, the time until a node will forge
- strip/crunch the history of the log (default: cdashboard.json), e.g. after 48h only 1 entry a week
- create a web interface to maintain the config.json
